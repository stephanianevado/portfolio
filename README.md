# Stephania Nevado's Portfolio

![][badge-ts] ![][badge-react] ![][badge-sc]

I could have created this portfolio with some online template or no-code solution - but I didn't want to do that ðŸ¤“ Instead, I've used this
portfolio as a way to showcase my skills and way of coding.

If you have a look inside this repository you'll find a well-organized, linted
and strictly formatted project with my own custom theme structure.

The code is formatted with [Prettier](.prettierrc.json) and linted with [ESLint](.eslintrc.json).
